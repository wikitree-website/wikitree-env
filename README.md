Environment variables for Wikitree's node server

### But why?
Wikitree is open source, but we plan to host user accounts and sessions on our server. As such, we need to keep certain things secret to maintain security and protect people's privacy.

### But why a separate repo?
It's easier to rebuild the server's repo from scratch if we keep environmental settings as a sibling folder.

### But why have this repo at all?
The local settings are fine to share, it's the release stuff we're worried about.
